**Notes from [Udemy] "REACT Course"** : 

[REACT-App] uses [Babel] and [Webpack].

[Babel] : Babel is a tool that makes sure that all your JavaScript works in all the browsers with different environments.

[Webpack] : Webpack takes all our JavaScript files and bundle everything up and optimize them for production.

So [REACT-App] does all of this for us in the backend with a team of developers working on it. 

[map] function in [REACT] returns us the value of a function iterated over all the items of an array. 

[REACT] needs a unique [key] for items in an array so that when the name or any other attribute gets updated in that array, 

A [REACT] *class* has three lifecycle methods, *Mounting*, *Updating*, *Unmounting*. 
    - In our [App.js] file, the App class has *componentDidMount*
    and *render* mehtods, both are lifecycle methods.
    - These methods allow you to control the component's behaviour and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle.
